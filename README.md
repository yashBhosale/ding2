# Welcome to the Warrior's Quest Play Test Kit!


## Getting Started

    1. Unzip the zip (You've already done this, good on you!)
    2. Run the .exe file
    3. Don't fiddle with the control menu, our tutorial assumes certain key maps.
    4. Press ok
    5. Play the game
    6. Send us feedback (will be discussed further down in this file.)


### If you have a controller

So Unity's kind of annoying when it comes to managing input. We've been able
to test for two different controllers- a Logitech F310 and an XBox One 
third-party controller. So basically we know that the controls are mapped 
correctly for the logitech controller and the XBox One controller. If you 
have either, I highly recommend using them. 

### If you don't have a controller

If you're playing keyboard mouse, please be aware that everything controls through
the keyboard. If you think we should use the mouse for aiming please let us know, but
for now it's strictly keyboard based.


### How to give us feedback

For expediency, we ask that you follow a couple rules.

* If you'd rather email me your suggestions, do it [here.] (bhosaley5@gmail.com) I check my email all the time.
* Put your feedback in a word/odt file, so that we can easily store/catalogue it.
* Title the email and/or word file as <Some Identifiable Name> Playtest Feedback, so we know who suggested what.
* Format your suggestions as a list such that each item is its own discrete idea. This makes reading through them
  much easier.


### Contributing

Once the semester ends, we're looking for a team to help us make this into a real, finished
game. Matt and I are pretty good programmers, but a good game has good art, stories, music, 
and much more other stuff that requires skills and time that we just don't have. We'll need
help.

If you're interested in helping us, please contact me through whatever medium you know 
me. I will not probably not respond to emails on the subject.
